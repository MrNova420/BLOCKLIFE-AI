## ⚠️ Important: This is a LOCAL Application

**BlockLife is NOT a website.** It is a local application that runs entirely on YOUR computer.

- ✅ Runs locally on your machine
- ✅ Dashboard at `localhost:3000` is only accessible from YOUR device
- ✅ All data stays on your computer
- ✅ No external servers, no cloud, no accounts required
- ✅ AI runs locally via Ollama (on your machine)

👉 **For detailed security and privacy information, see [SECURITY-AND-PRIVACY.md](SECURITY-AND-PRIVACY.md)**

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
npm install && npm start
```

The web dashboard opens automatically at **http://localhost:3000**

---

## 🎮 How to Use

### Step 1: Start BlockLife
```bash
npm install && npm start
```

### Step 2: Install a Local AI Model (Recommended)

BlockLife uses **locally hosted AI models** via [Ollama](https://ollama.com). This runs entirely on your machine - no cloud, no API keys, no internet required.

```bash
# Install Ollama from https://ollama.com
# Then pull a model:
ollama pull tinyllama      # Fast, ~600MB (recommended for most)
ollama pull mistral        # High quality, ~4GB
ollama pull llama2         # Good general, ~4GB
```

### Step 3: Connect to Your Minecraft Server

In the dashboard:
1. Go to **Server Setup**
2. Enter your Minecraft server address (e.g., `localhost:25565`)
3. Select Java or Bedrock Edition
4. Click **Connect**

### Step 4: Spawn Bots & Start Simulation

Use the chat panel:
```
create 20 bots        # Spawn 20 villagers
start simulation      # Begin the simulation
```

Or click **Start Simulation** in the dashboard.

### Step 5: Command Your Civilization

Talk to the AI in natural language:
```
build a castle
mine for diamonds
tell Erik to farm wheat
explore the mountains
attack the zombies
status
help
```

## What is BlockLife?

BlockLife is a **living Minecraft civilization** that runs autonomously. Not a script. Not an automation tool. A tiny universe, evolving on your device.

**The Experience:**
- You start it, connect to your server, and let it run
- Come back hours or days later
- Bots built structures, farmed, mined, fought
- Some died, some had children
- Villages grew, split, or went to war
- They remember what happened and talk about it

**This is civilization in your pocket - for real.**

|-------|------|-------|---------|
| TinyLlama | 637MB | ⚡⚡⚡ Fast | Good |
| Phi-2 | 1.7GB | ⚡⚡ Medium | Better |
| Gemma 2B | 1.4GB | ⚡⚡ Medium | Better |
| Mistral 7B | 4.1GB | ⚡ Slower | Best |

## Troubleshooting

### Bots not connecting to server?
- Make sure your Minecraft server is running
- Check the server address and port
- For Bedrock, use the correct port (default: 19132)

### AI not working?
- Install Ollama: https://ollama.com
- Pull a model: `ollama pull tinyllama`
- Make sure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`

### Performance issues?
- Use ECO mode in the dashboard
- Reduce bot count
- Use TinyLlama instead of larger models

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this a website?
**No.** BlockLife is a local application that runs on your computer. The "dashboard" at `localhost:3000` is just a control panel on YOUR machine - it's not a public website.

### Does this collect my data?
**No.** There are no external servers, no analytics, no tracking. Everything runs locally on your device.

### What is "localhost:3000"?
`localhost` means "your own computer." When you run BlockLife, it starts a local web server just for the control panel. Only you can access it from your device.

### Do I need an account?
**No.** There is no registration, no login, no accounts. Just run the application and use it.

### Is my data sent anywhere?
**No.** All bot data, village data, and settings stay on your computer. The only network connections are:
1. To YOUR Minecraft server (that you specify)
2. To Ollama running on YOUR machine (if you use AI features)
